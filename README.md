# DataExplorationProject
This repo is for my Data Exploration Project in uni.  This is a graded project to be handed in.

aufschreiben: welches ist für mich die richtige Metrik, hängt von meiner Zielsetzung ab 
classification for 6th  stage -> to show which

# describtion of columns 
T stage (Tumour describes the size or area of the cancer) in mm
- T1 : tumour is <= 2 centimetres (cm) across
- T2 : cancer is > 2 cm and < 5 cm
- T3 : cancer is > 5 cm
- T4 is divided into 4 groups:

T4a means the cancer has spread into the chest wall
T4b means the cancer has spread into the skin and the breast might be swollen
T4c means the cancer has spread to both the skin and the chest wall
T4d means inflammatory carcinoma. This is a rare type of breast cancer

-> T4 means cancer has spread to skin and/or chest wall
Tumor of any size growing into the chest wall or skin. This includes inflammatory breast cancer


N Stage (Node (N) describes whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes ) -> why is there no N0 (not spread to any lymph nodes)

- N1 : Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary (underarm) lymph node(s), and/or cancer is found in internal mammary lymph nodes (those near the breast bone) on sentinel lymph node biopsy
- N2 : Cancer has spread to 4 to 9 lymph nodes under the arm, or cancer has enlarged the internal mammary lymph nodes
- N3 : Cancer has spread to 10 or more axillary lymph nodes , or spread to the lymph nodes under the collarbone (infraclavicular nodes), or at least one axillary lymph node (with at least one area of cancer spread greater than 2 mm) and has enlarged the internal mammary lymph nodes, or 4 or more axillary lymph nodes (with at least one area of cancer spread greater than 2 mm), and to the internal mammary lymph nodes on sentinel lymph node biopsy, or lymph nodes above the collarbone (supraclavicular nodes) on the same side of the cancer with at least one area of cancer spread greater than 2 mm

6th Stage (6th stage is the different levels of breast cancer development and it represents the current status of the cancer)
- IIA
- IIB
- IIIA
- IIIB
- IIIC

differentiate
- moderately : The cells are growing at a speed of and look like cells somewhere between grades 1 and 3.
- poorly : The cancer cells look very different from normal cells and will probably grow and spread faster
- well : The cells are slower-growing, and look more like normal breast cells
- undifferentiated

Grade (How much do the cancer cells look like normal cells)
- 1 : usually means the cancer is slower-growing and less likely to spread.
- 2 : means the cancer is growing faster than a grade 1 cancer but slower than a grade 3 cancer
- 3 : means a faster-growing cancer that’s more likely to spread
- anaplastic, IV

A Stage
- Regional : The lymph nodes, primarily those in the armpit, are involved

- Distant : The cancer is found in other parts of the body as well

Estrogen Status (Does the cancer have the protein called an estrogen receptor?)
- positive
- negative

Progesterone Status (Does the cancer have the protein called a progesterone receptor?)
- positive
- negative

About 3 of 4 breast cancers have at least one of these receptors. This percentage is higher in older women than in younger women. DCIS should also be checked for hormone receptors.
Test results will give you your hormone receptor status. It will say a tumor is hormone receptor-positive if at least 1% of the cells tested have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. Otherwise, the test will say the tumor is hormone receptor-negative (Quelle: https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/understanding-a-breast-cancer-diagnosis/breast-cancer-hormone-receptor-status.html)
